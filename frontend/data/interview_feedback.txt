Candidate: Sanjay Anbazhagan
Role: Junior Software Engineer
Interviewer: Jane Smith, Senior Engineer

Overall Impression:
Sanjay is enthusiastic and clearly passionate about technology. His portfolio demonstrates a very strong eye for design and frontend implementation.

Technical Feedback:
- When asked to describe his projects, he did an excellent job.
- Whiteboard coding session was a major challenge for him. He struggled to articulate his thought process for an algorithmic problem (finding cycles in a graph). He seemed nervous and his verbal communication became unclear under pressure.
- His approach to the algorithm was brute-force and inefficient. He could not explain Big O notation for his own solution.

Strengths:
- Excellent portfolio and project presentation.
- Deep knowledge of React hooks and component lifecycle.

Areas for Improvement:
- Fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Communicating technical thought process during problem-solving.
- System design knowledge is very limited.

Recommendation:
Not a fit for this specific backend-heavy role. However, his frontend skills are impressive. He might be a great fit for a UI Engineer or Frontend Developer role. Consider re-evaluating for a different team.
